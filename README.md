# Spotify Automation

Automate playlist generation using Python and the Spotify API. The code searches through the user's saved library to generate a playlist given a specific filter criteria. Possible playlist management includes:
- recently added songs (default: 20 songs)
- filters from a list of artists
- filters from a range of release dates
